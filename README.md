============================
Very similar to c, with slight differences

Includes at the top, just like in c

Main function, like c as well

variable definition: type is not specified, use var
  var x = 123
  var str = 'string'
  var temp
  
Statements end with a '$'

Strings can be added together with '+'

Will support arrays down the road, will have built in functions

Print with 'call print()'

============================
To run Lexer using makefile commands:

  make : compiles test-env executable
  
  make run : compiles test-env executable and executes the test case
  
  make clean : gets rid of all .o files and executables
